Optional:
  - restructuring the front comps as well for better readability is advisable. 
  - hide error if it came from clicking the stop button
  - testing

Oddities:
  - Two app instances are opened - This one is hard to debug since I'm not sure how to reproduce it and it happens pretty randomly

a long run commit:
  - pacakge ffmpeg binaries in final build - I tried many things, check out hte README.md logs
