- Why is the video thumbnail gone?
- WHy do I see JPG.avif file types?

Optional:
  - restructuring the front comps as well for better readability is advisable. 
  - hide error if it came from clicking the stop button
  - testing
  - Allocate all threads to last item! That's basically adding a conditional to the process soemthing?
  - as of now I use conditional to overcoe the unreliability of progress.percent - it means though that sgaps are possible in the progress bar in front
    this can be perhaps solved by investigating the progress object further or providing an estimtaete and updating in intervals
  - Properly explain each conversion param and perform extensive size/quality comparison tests

Oddities:
  - Two app instances are opened - This one is hard to debug since I'm not sure how to reproduce it and it happens pretty randomly

a long run commit:
  - pacakge ffmpeg binaries in final build - I tried many things, check out hte README.md logs

Important measurements:
  a 15 seconds video:
    preset 6 1 minute 182mb to 40.7mb
    preset 4 2 minutes 182mb to 35.6mb
    x2 more time and 1.15 less size

  3 seconds video: 
    preset 4 30 seconds 20.3mb to 646kb with lanczos
    preset 4 1 minute 20.3mb to 1.76mb without lanczos
    preset 6 15 seconds 20.3mb to 763kb with lanczos
    x2 more time and 1.2 less size

  Note that these are relative not absolute values, I think 4 is a good fit for now. 
  It's also recommended by several AI assistants. 

  Note that without lanczos it takes about twice the time since there are more pixels to process. 
  It makes sense since 1080p is about twice lower than 4k. The size difference is also twice...
  Use lanczos!
