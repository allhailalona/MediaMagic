Optional n oddities:
  - restructuring the front comps as well for better readability is advisable. 
  - add lines animation to easily distinguish between dir levels - might be unnecessasrily complex
  - start app only once - I suspect the issue is in the index comp which runs twice - check logs - for now it seems alright

a long run commit:
