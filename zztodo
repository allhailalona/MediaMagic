USE HUSKY WITH CONVENTIONAL COMMIT!
test bigtime then go running

I think including it all in one commit is advisable - the restructuring hte bug fix, husky etc
also squash the update readme commit, it's dirtying my repo

a long run commit:
restructuring the front comps as well for better readability is advisable. But for now I think that's enough
do not allow to LOAD, instead of expand/convert empty folders - add another checker to handleGetDetails or something similar
solve this white window thing - the entirecomp is running twice - check logs
solve the packaging issue

a really long run commit:
ADD TESTING!
