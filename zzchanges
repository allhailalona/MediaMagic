- Small adjustments to videos and images conversion settings:
  - use lanczos for conversion from 4k to 1080
  - use commonOptions for convertImage func for better readability
  - make sure the container is avif for compatability

- Solve the double folder toggle by adding the size comparison as well (the size is mostly unique to each dir)
- Don't clear the output on clear all!
- Attempt to wrap ffmpeg binaries in the final build unsuccessfully
